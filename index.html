        <p><em>Junior Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>I am currently a Training Manager for <a href="https://renterswarehouse.com/">Renters Warehouse</a> located in Minneapolis, MN. I have worked there for 4 years.
          I have recently decided to make a change in my career and gain some new skills that set me apart from others. I have
          always wanted to learn how to code. I love to do puzzles and logic games, so thinking of how to create websites and
          have them function in certain ways appeals to me as a career.</p>
